# Exploring Fitting Strategies

Explore strategies for constructing an approximate Hessian given the training data
produced from [one of our sampling strategies](../1_explore-sampling-methods/).
Each notebook writes data to a separate subdirectory with at least one ASE VibrationData
object in JSON format named after the molecule being studied, the accuracy level,
and the source of the sampling data.
